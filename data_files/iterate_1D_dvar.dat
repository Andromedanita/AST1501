 Possible causes: 1 error in function or gradient evaluation;
                  2 rounding error dominate computation.

 Line search cannot locate an adequate point after 20 function
  and gradient evaluations.  Previous x, f and g restored.
 Possible causes: 1 error in function or gradient evaluation;
                  2 rounding error dominate computation.
